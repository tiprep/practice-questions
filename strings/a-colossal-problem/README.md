Professor Integer has uncovered a cache of ancient texts detailing the
number of people in attendance at various colosseum events. He was able
to scan one of the pages and convert it to text, but unfortunately 
his OCR program doesn't handle automatic conversion of Roman numerals.

Your task is to write a simple program that will convert Roman numerals
to integers so that Professor Integer can continue with his analysis of
these important historical records.

You can find the original data in `records.txt`. Although the Colosseum
had a capacity of over 50,000 spectators, it appears the first page is
from one of the slow months - each day had between 1,000 and 5,000 
attendees.
